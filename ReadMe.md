Software engineering is a branch of both computer science and engineering focused on the design, implementation, and maintenance of software systems. It develops software systems by applying engineering principles and computer programming expertise to meet user needs.

Computer Science
--------------
```
CS fundemntals are so important for any software engineer to have a solid foundation in them.
All technologies are built on top of these fundemntals with different flavors.

* Mathematics
* Database
* Operating Systems
* Algorithms and Data Structures
* Computer Networks
* Programming Languages

Software Engineering
------------------
```
Software Engineering is the application of engineering principles to the design, implementation, and maintenance of software systems.

A software system is a living being, it has a life cycle, it has a birth, it has a growth, it has a maturity, it has a decline, and it has a death. It goes through different stages and it has different needs at different stages.
being aware of that is important even if you are not involved in each stage of the software development life cycle (SDLC).
